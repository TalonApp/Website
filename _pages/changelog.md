Additional new features for Talon.

#### What's New
- Introducing our brand new link shortener, talon.link. We developed it in house, for our loyal Talon Pro users to enjoy. Give it a go!
- We've added support for a new service, IFTTT! With IFTTT, you can execute prebuilt actions for basically anything on the web, from something as basic as sending a tweet, or something more intricate, like sending an email.
- Re-introducing custom App Icons! They were removed in a previous update, but they're now back - with some new icons from the community.
- We updated the keyboard layout to use the typical one you'd see across iOS, rather than the weird one optimized for entering emails.
