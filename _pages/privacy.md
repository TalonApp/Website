# Privacy Policy

As a developer, I do not believe in collecting and selling personal user data. Privacy matters to me. That's why we don't collect too much data from Ruby.

## Analytics

To best understand how our users utilize our app, we collect anonymous analytics about the actions taking place in our app. This doesn't involve any personal information. For complete transparency, you can visit our analytics provider [here](https://telemetrydeck.com).

## Third Parties

Since Talon interfaces with third party services (Discord, Slack, IFTTT, etc) - your information is sent to them, and they may process that information on their own. Please reference their Privacy Policies.

## The App

Talon does not collect any data from the users for running the app. Talon does however use iCloud (operated by Apple) to sync your user data across devices.
